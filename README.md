### I am Danil Barutov, an aspiring Python backend developer.  
I self-studied a modern Python web development stack (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Pydantic, Pytest, and GitHub Actions) in an intensive seven-day period and built a ToDo REST API project to demonstrate my skills.  
Despite having no formal industry experience, I have completed this case project and undertaken freelance development work.  
I am passionate about backend development and continuously learning to improve my skills.

## Case Project: ToDo REST API

**Project Title**: ToDo REST API  

**Objective**: Develop a complete RESTful API for managing a to-do list, demonstrating proficiency in backend development and best practices.  

**Architecture**: The project uses a modular architecture with separate modules for database models, API routes, and data schemas. It includes SQLAlchemy models for database interactions, Pydantic schemas for input/output validation, and Alembic for database migrations.  

**Tech Stack**: FastAPI (web framework), SQLAlchemy (ORM), Alembic (database migrations), Pydantic (data validation), Pytest (testing), Git & GitHub Actions (version control and CI/CD).  

**Key Components**: CRUD API endpoints for task management, proper data validation and error handling, database migrations, and automated tests.
